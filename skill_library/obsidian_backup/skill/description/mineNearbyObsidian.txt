async function mineNearbyObsidian(bot) {
    // The function involves mining a nearby obsidian block using a diamond pickaxe. It first checks if a diamond pickaxe is available in the inventory. If the pickaxe is found, it equips it in the hand. Then, it searches for an obsidian block within a 32-block radius. If an obsidian block is located, it proceeds to mine one block of obsidian. If no diamond pickaxe is found or no obsidian block is nearby, it exits the process.
