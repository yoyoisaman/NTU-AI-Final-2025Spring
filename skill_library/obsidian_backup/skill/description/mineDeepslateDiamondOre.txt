async function mineDeepslateDiamondOre(bot) {
    // The function involves mining a deepslate diamond ore using an iron pickaxe. It first checks if an iron pickaxe is available in the inventory and equips it. Then, it searches for a deepslate diamond ore block within a 32-block radius. If the ore is found, it proceeds to mine the block. Finally, it notifies the user that the deepslate diamond ore has been successfully mined. If no iron pickaxe is available or no ore is found, it informs the user accordingly.
