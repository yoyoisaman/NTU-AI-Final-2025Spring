async function placeChest(bot) {
    // The function involves placing a chest from the inventory near the bot. It first checks if a chest is available in the inventory. If a chest is found, it searches for a suitable position adjacent to the bot where the chest can be placed. The function checks for air blocks in four possible directions around the bot. If a suitable position is found, the chest is placed at that location. If no suitable position is found, the function exits without placing the chest.
