The Golden Sword is a weapon that, while less durable than others, can be useful in specific situations due to its faster attack speed.\n\n### Required Materials:\n- **Gold Ingots**: 2\n  - **Notes**: Gold Ingots can be obtained by smelting raw gold ore in a furnace. Gold ore is typically found between layers 0-32 in the Overworld.\n- **Sticks**: 1\n  - **Notes**: Sticks are crafted from wooden planks. Place two wooden planks vertically in your crafting interface to create four sticks.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide:\n\n1. **Gather Wood**:\n   - Locate a tree and break it with your hands to obtain wood logs.\n   - Open your inventory and place the wood logs in the crafting area to convert them into wooden planks.\n\n2. **Craft a Crafting Table**:\n   - Place four wooden planks in a 2x2 grid in your crafting interface to create a crafting table.\n\n3. **Craft Sticks**:\n   - Place two wooden planks vertically in the crafting table to make four sticks.\n\n4. **Mine Gold Ore**:\n   - Locate a cave system and mine gold ore using an iron pickaxe or better. Gold ore blocks drop raw gold when mined.\n\n5. **Smelt Gold Ingots**:\n   - Collect cobblestone to craft a furnace. Place eight cobblestone in a ring shape in the crafting table.\n   - Use the furnace to smelt raw gold into gold ingots. Place raw gold in the top slot and fuel (such as coal or wood) in the bottom slot.\n\n6. **Craft the Golden Sword**:\n   - Open the crafting table interface.\n   - Place two gold ingots in the first and second slots of the middle column of the 3x3 crafting grid.\n   - Place one stick in the bottom slot of the middle column.\n   - Drag the resulting Golden Sword into your inventory.\n\n### Important Considerations/Tips:\n- **Durability**: The Golden Sword has lower durability compared to other swords. It may break quickly, so consider having extra gold or other weapons as backups.\n- **Speed Advantage**: Despite low durability, a Golden Sword has a faster attack speed than other swords, making it useful in situations where quick attacks are needed.\n- **Mining Requirements**: Remember that you need at least an iron pickaxe to mine gold ore. Prepare accordingly by crafting an iron pickaxe from iron ingots if you don't have one.\n- **Gold Ore Locations**: Gold ore is more commonly found in the Badlands biome, so it may be worth exploring these areas for easier access to gold."
