It requires specific materials and a bit of strategy to gather them, especially as you'll be starting with nothing. This guide will help you collect the necessary resources, construct the portal, and light it to enter the Nether safely. We'll focus on constructing the **minimum effective portal**, which requires 10 blocks of **Obsidian**.\n\n### Required Materials:\n- **Obsidian**: 10 blocks \n  - **How to Obtain**: You need to mine obsidian, which can **only be mined with a Diamond Pickaxe** (or Netherite Pickaxe). Obsidian is created when **water touches a lava source block**.\n  - **Crafting**: Not applicable, as obsidian cannot be crafted. You must mine it directly.\n  \n- **Flint and Steel**: 1 \n  - **How to Obtain**: \n    - **Flint**: Mine **Gravel** blocks (found naturally in the world, often near rivers or caves) until flint drops. Each gravel block has a chance to drop flint when broken.\n    - **Steel (Iron Ingot)**: Smelt **Iron Ore** in a **Furnace** (you'll need 1 iron ore for this) to obtain an **Iron Ingot**. \n  - **Crafting Recipe (3x3 grid)**: \n    ```\n    X     | X     | X\n    X     | Iron  | X\n    Flint | X     | X\n    ```\n\n- **Diamond Pickaxe**: 1 \n  - **How to Obtain**: Crafting. Requires **3 Diamonds** and **2 Sticks**.\n  - **Crafting Recipe (3x3 grid)**:\n    ```\n    Diamond | Diamond | Diamond\n    X       | Stick   | X\n    X       | Stick   | X\n    ```\n\n- **Crafting Table**: 1\n  - **How to Obtain**: Craft from 4 **Wood Planks** (obtained by converting Wood Logs).\n  - **Crafting Recipe (2x2 grid in inventory)**:\n    ```\n    Wood Plank | Wood Plank\n    Wood Plank | Wood Plank\n    ```\n\n- **Furnace**: 1\n  - **How to Obtain**: Craft from 8 **Cobblestone**.\n  - **Crafting Recipe (3x3 grid)**:\n    ```\n    Cobblestone | Cobblestone | Cobblestone\n    Cobblestone | X           | Cobblestone\n    Cobblestone | Cobblestone | Cobblestone\n    ```\n\n- **Iron Ingots**: 3 (Minimum for Flint and Steel, and potentially a Water Bucket if creating obsidian manually)\n  - **How to Obtain**: Smelt **Iron Ore** in a **Furnace**.\n- **Wood Logs**: ~15-20 (Estimate: For initial tools, crafting table, sticks, and enough charcoal for furnace fuel).\n- **Cobblestone**: ~20 (Estimate: For initial stone pickaxe, furnace, and general mining).\n- **Diamonds**: 3 (To craft a Diamond Pickaxe).\n- **Water Bucket**: 1 (Optional, but highly recommended for safely creating obsidian from lava pools). Requires 3 **Iron Ingots**.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide:\n1.  **Gather Initial Resources**: Start by punching down trees to acquire enough **Wood Logs** (aim for about 5-6 logs initially, which will give you plenty of planks for early tools and a crafting table. You'll need more later for fuel).\n2.  **Craft a Crafting Table**: Open your inventory. Convert some **Wood Logs** into **Wood Planks** (1 Log yields 4 Planks). Then, place 4 **Wood Planks** in a 2x2 grid in your inventory's crafting area to create a **Crafting Table**.\n3.  **Place Crafting Table**: Right-click (or use the action button for your platform) to place the **Crafting Table** on the ground.\n4.  **Craft a Wooden Pickaxe**: With the **Crafting Table** placed, craft 2 **Sticks** (using 2 **Wood Planks**). Then, place 3 **Wood Planks** across the top row of the 3x3 crafting grid and 2 **Sticks** in the middle column (one below the other) to make a **Wooden Pickaxe**.\n5.  **Mine Cobblestone (for Furnace & Stone Pickaxe)**: Use your **Wooden Pickaxe** to mine at least 8 **Cobblestone** for a **Furnace**. While you're at it, mine 3 more **Cobblestone** for a **Stone Pickaxe**. It's smart to gather extra **Cobblestone** (~20 total) for future needs and torches.\n6.  **Craft a Furnace**: Use the **Crafting Table**. Place 8 **Cobblestone** in every slot of the 3x3 grid except the very center to craft a **Furnace**. Place the **Furnace** on the ground.\n7.  **Craft a Stone Pickaxe**: Using the **Crafting Table**, combine 3 **Cobblestone** (top row) and 2 **Sticks** (middle column) to craft a **Stone Pickaxe**. This is more efficient for mining iron and diamonds.\n8.  **Mine Iron Ore & Acquire Fuel**: Find **Iron Ore** (it looks orange-brown in stone, often in caves). Mine at least 3 blocks. Also, acquire **Coal** (from mining coal ore) or make **Charcoal** (by smelting **Wood Logs** in your **Furnace**) to use as fuel.\n9.  **Smelt Iron Ore**: Place your **Iron Ore** in the top slot of the **Furnace** and **Coal/Charcoal** in the bottom slot. Wait for it to smelt into **Iron Ingots**. Smelt all 3 **Iron Ingots** you mined.\n10. **Mine Diamonds**: Descend deep underground, typically to Y-level 16 or below (check your debug screen by pressing F3). Use your **Stone Pickaxe** to mine through stone until you find **Diamond Ore**. Mine 3 **Diamond Ore** blocks (each drops 1 **Diamond**) using your **Iron Pickaxe**. If you don't have an Iron Pickaxe yet, prioritize crafting one (using 3 **Iron Ingots** and 2 **Sticks**).\n11. **Craft a Diamond Pickaxe**: Using the **Crafting Table**, combine 3 **Diamonds** (top row) and 2 **Sticks** (middle column) to craft your **Diamond Pickaxe**. This is crucial for mining **Obsidian**.\n12. **Acquire Obsidian (10 blocks)**:\n    - **Method A (Natural)**: Locate areas where **Lava** flows naturally into **Water** (often in ravines or caves). Use your **Diamond Pickaxe** to mine the resulting **Obsidian** blocks.\n    - **Method B (Manual Creation - Recommended for reliability)**: Craft a **Water Bucket** (using 3 **Iron Ingots** in a V-shape on the **Crafting Table**). Find a large **Lava** pool (often underground). Use your **Water Bucket** to carefully pour water onto **Lava Source Blocks** to create **Obsidian**. Mine these **Obsidian** blocks with your **Diamond Pickaxe**. Repeat until you have 10 **Obsidian** blocks.\n13. **Mine Flint**: Find **Gravel** blocks (often in rivers or caves) and mine them until you obtain at least 1 **Flint** (it drops randomly from **Gravel**).\n14. **Craft Flint and Steel**: Using the **Crafting Table**, place 1 **Iron Ingot** in the middle slot and 1 **Flint** in the slot directly above it (or any diagonal for older versions) to craft **Flint and Steel**.\n15. **Construct the Nether Portal Frame (10-block minimal)**:\n    - Choose a flat, open, and safe location for your portal.\n    - **Base**: Place 2 **Obsidian** blocks horizontally on the ground. This forms the very bottom edge of your portal.\n    - **Pillars**: From each end of this 2-block base, place 3 **Obsidian** blocks vertically upwards. This creates two side pillars, each **4 blocks tall in total** (counting the base block they sit on).\n    - **Top**: Connect the tops of these two pillars with 2 **Obsidian** blocks placed horizontally.\n    - **Final Structure Check**: You now have an open rectangular frame, **3 blocks wide** by **4 blocks tall** (outer dimensions), enclosing a 2x3 empty space. You have used exactly 10 **Obsidian** blocks.\n16. **Activate the Portal**: With the portal frame complete, select your **Flint and Steel**. Right-click (or use the action button for your platform) on *any* of the inner obsidian blocks that form the frame (not the empty space) to create the purple portal effect.\n17. **Enter the Nether**: Walk into the purple portal. After a brief animation, you will be teleported to the dangerous Nether dimension.\n\n### Important Considerations/Tips:\n-   **Mining Obsidian is Slow**: Mining obsidian takes a long time (about 9.4 seconds per block with a **Diamond Pickaxe**); ensure you have a safe area to mine it without enemies nearby.\n-   **Lava Safety**: Always be extremely cautious around lava. If you're creating obsidian manually, have a **Water Bucket** ready to extinguish yourself if you catch fire.\n-   **Portal Location**: Consider building your portal in a safe area, preferably away from hostile mobs. Remember its coordinates, as this is where you'll return.\n-   **Resource Preparation for Nether**: Before entering the Nether, ensure you have adequate resources. This includes food, weapons, armor, extra tools, and potentially some Gold Ingots (for trading with Piglins). The Nether is dangerous!\n-   **Portal Size**: While you can create larger portals (up to 23x23 inner space, requiring 14 blocks for a 4x5 outer frame, or more for larger frames), the 10-block minimal portal is just as functional and resource-efficient."
