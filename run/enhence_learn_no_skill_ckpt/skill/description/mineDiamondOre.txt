async function mineDiamondOre(bot) {
    // The function involves mining 5 diamond ores using an iron pickaxe. It first checks if an iron pickaxe is available in the inventory and equips it. If the pickaxe is not available, the process is halted. The function then searches for diamond ore blocks within a specified distance. Upon finding a diamond ore block, it mines the block and increments the count of mined diamonds. The process continues until 5 diamond ores are mined or no more diamond ores are found nearby.
