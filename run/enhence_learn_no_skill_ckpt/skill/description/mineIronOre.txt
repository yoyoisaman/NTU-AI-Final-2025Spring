async function mineIronOre(bot) {
    // The function involves mining 5 iron ore blocks using a stone pickaxe. It first checks if a stone pickaxe is available in the inventory and equips it. If no stone pickaxe is found, the process stops. The function then searches for iron ore blocks within a certain distance. Once an iron ore block is found, it is mined, and the count of mined iron ore is updated. The process continues until 5 iron ore blocks are mined or no more iron ore can be found nearby.
