async function obtainJungleLogs(bot) {
    // The function is about collecting a total of 10 jungle logs. It first checks the current inventory to determine how many more jungle logs are needed. If fewer than 10 logs are present, it calculates the number of additional logs required. The function then explores the environment to find jungle log blocks within a certain distance. For each log needed, it attempts to locate and mine a jungle log block. The process continues until the required number of logs is collected or no more logs can be found nearby.
