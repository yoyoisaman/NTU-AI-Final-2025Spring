async function mineCoalOre(bot) {
    // The function is about collecting a total of 10 coal items. It first checks the current inventory to determine how many more coal items are needed. If a stone pickaxe is available, it equips it for mining. The function then searches for coal ore blocks within a certain distance. It continues to mine coal ore until the required amount of coal is collected or no more coal ore can be found nearby. If successful, it confirms the collection of 10 coal; otherwise, it indicates the shortfall.
