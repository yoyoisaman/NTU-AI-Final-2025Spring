async function smeltRawCopper(bot) {
    // The function involves smelting 23 raw copper into copper ingots using a furnace and coal as fuel. It first checks if a furnace is available in the inventory. If a furnace is not found, the process is halted. If a furnace is available, it is placed near the bot. The function then proceeds to smelt the raw copper using coal. Once the smelting is complete, the bot confirms the successful conversion of raw copper into copper ingots.
