async function mineLapisLazuliOre(bot) {
    // The function involves mining 5 lapis lazuli ores using a stone pickaxe. It first checks if a stone pickaxe is available in the inventory and equips it. If no stone pickaxe is found, the process is halted. The function then searches for lapis lazuli ore blocks within a certain distance. Upon finding an ore block, it mines the block and increments the count of mined ores. The process continues until 5 ores are mined or no more ores are found nearby.
