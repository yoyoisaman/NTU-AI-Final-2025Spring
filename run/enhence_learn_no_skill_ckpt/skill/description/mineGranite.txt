async function mineGranite(bot) {
    // The function involves mining 10 granite blocks using a pickaxe. It first checks the inventory for a stone or wooden pickaxe and equips it if available. If no pickaxe is found, the process is halted. The function then searches for granite blocks within a 32-block radius. Upon finding a granite block, it mines the block and increments the count of mined granite. This process continues until 10 granite blocks are mined or no more granite is found nearby.
