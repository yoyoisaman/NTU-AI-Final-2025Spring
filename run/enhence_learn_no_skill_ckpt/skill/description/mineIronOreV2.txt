async function mineIronOre(bot) {
    // The function involves mining iron ore using an iron pickaxe. It first checks if an iron pickaxe is available in the inventory and equips it. Then, it calculates how much raw iron is needed to reach a total of 15. The function searches for iron ore blocks within a certain distance and mines them one by one until the required amount of raw iron is obtained. If enough iron ore is mined, it confirms success; otherwise, it indicates the need to find more iron ore.
