async function mineWoodLog(bot) {
    // The function is about finding and mining a single wood log. It first defines a helper function to locate a log block within a specified distance. The function then explores the environment in random directions until a log block is found or a time limit is reached. If a log block is found, it proceeds to mine the log. If no log is found within the search area, it indicates that no logs are nearby.
