async function mineCoalOre(bot) {
    // The function is about collecting a total of 10 coal items. It first checks the current inventory to determine how many more coal items are needed. If less than 10 coal items are present, it checks for a pickaxe in the inventory and equips it if available. The function then searches for coal ore blocks within a certain distance and mines them until the required amount of coal is collected. If the bot successfully mines enough coal, it confirms the achievement; otherwise, it indicates the need to find more coal ore.
