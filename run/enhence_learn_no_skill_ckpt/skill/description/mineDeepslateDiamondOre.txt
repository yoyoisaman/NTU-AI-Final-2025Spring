async function mineDeepslateDiamondOre(bot) {
    // The function involves mining 5 deepslate diamond ores using a diamond pickaxe. It first checks if a diamond pickaxe is available in the inventory and equips it. Then, it searches for deepslate diamond ore blocks within a 32-block radius. If a block is found, it mines the block and increments the count of mined ores. The process repeats until 5 ores are mined or no more ores are found nearby. If fewer than 5 ores are mined, it indicates the need to find more ores.
