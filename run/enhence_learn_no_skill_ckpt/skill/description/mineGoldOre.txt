async function mineGoldOre(bot) {
    // The function involves mining 5 gold ore blocks using an iron pickaxe. It first checks if an iron pickaxe is available in the inventory and equips it. If no iron pickaxe is found, the process is halted. The function then searches for gold ore blocks within a specified distance. Upon finding a gold ore block, it mines the block and increments the count of mined gold ore. The process continues until 5 gold ore blocks are mined or no more gold ore is found nearby.
