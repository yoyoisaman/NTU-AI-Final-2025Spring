async function mineCopperOre(bot) {
    // The function is about mining 2 copper ore blocks using a stone pickaxe. It first checks if a stone pickaxe is available in the inventory and equips it. If no stone pickaxe is found, the function exits. The function then searches for copper ore blocks within a certain distance. If a copper ore block is found, it mines the block and increments the count of mined copper ore. The process continues until 2 copper ore blocks are mined or no more copper ore is found nearby.
