async function mineDeepslateDiamondOre(bot) {
    // The function involves mining 10 deepslate diamond ores using a diamond pickaxe. It first checks if a diamond pickaxe is available in the inventory and equips it. Then, it defines a helper function to locate deepslate diamond ore blocks within a certain distance. The function enters a loop to explore the surroundings and mine deepslate diamond ore blocks until 10 are collected. If a block is found, it is mined, and the count of mined ores is updated. The process continues until either 10 ores are mined or no more ores can be found nearby.
