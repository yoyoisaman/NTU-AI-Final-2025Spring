async function mineGoldOre(bot) {
    // The function involves mining 10 gold ore blocks using an iron pickaxe. It first checks if an iron pickaxe is available in the inventory and equips it. If no iron pickaxe is found, the process stops. The function then searches for gold ore blocks within a certain distance. Upon finding a gold ore block, it mines the block and increments the count of mined gold ore. The process continues until 10 gold ore blocks are mined or no more gold ore is found nearby.
