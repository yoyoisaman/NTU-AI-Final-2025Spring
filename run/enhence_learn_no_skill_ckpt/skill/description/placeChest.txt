async function placeChest(bot) {
    // The function involves placing a chest in the game world. It first checks if there is a chest available in the bot's inventory. If a chest is available, it searches for a suitable position adjacent to the bot to place the chest. The function checks in four possible directions around the bot for an empty space. If an empty space is found, the chest is placed at that location. If no suitable location is found, it indicates that placement is not possible.
