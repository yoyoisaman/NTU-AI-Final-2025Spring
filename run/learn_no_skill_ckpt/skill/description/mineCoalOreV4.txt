async function mineCoalOre(bot) {
    // The function involves searching for and mining a coal ore block. It first checks if a coal ore block is within a 32-block radius. If found, it proceeds to mine the block. If not found, it explores the surroundings for up to 60 seconds to locate a coal ore block. Upon finding a coal ore during exploration, it mines the block. If no coal ore is found after exploration, it concludes without mining.
