async function mineThreeCoalOre(bot) {
    // The function involves mining three coal ore blocks. It first checks if there are at least three coal ore blocks within a 32-block radius. If not enough coal ore blocks are found, it explores the surroundings to locate more. Once three or more coal ore blocks are identified, it proceeds to mine them. If successful, it confirms the mining of three coal ore blocks. If not enough coal ore blocks are found, it indicates the failure to locate sufficient coal ore nearby.
