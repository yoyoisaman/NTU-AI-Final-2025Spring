async function mineThreeIronOre(bot) {
    // The function involves mining three iron ore blocks using a stone pickaxe. It first checks if a stone pickaxe is available in the inventory, and if not, it crafts one by ensuring there are enough cobblestones and sticks, crafting them if necessary, and using a crafting table. Once the stone pickaxe is equipped, the function searches for iron ore blocks within a certain distance. If fewer than three iron ore blocks are found, it explores the environment to locate more. Once enough iron ore blocks are located, it proceeds to mine three of them. If it cannot find enough iron ore, it indicates the failure to do so.
