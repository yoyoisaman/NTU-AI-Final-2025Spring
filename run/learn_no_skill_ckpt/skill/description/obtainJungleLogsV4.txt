async function obtainJungleLogs(bot) {
    // The function is about collecting at least 3 jungle logs. It first checks the current inventory to see if there are already 3 or more jungle logs. If not, it searches for a jungle log block within a 32-block radius. If no jungle log is found nearby, it explores the area to locate one. Once a jungle log is found, it mines the necessary number of logs to reach a total of 3. If no jungle logs are found after exploring, it indicates that none could be located nearby.
