async function craftCraftingTable(bot) {
    // The function is about crafting a crafting table if one is not already present in the inventory. It first checks the inventory for an existing crafting table. If none is found, it proceeds to convert available logs (jungle or oak) into planks. The function calculates the number of planks that can be crafted from the logs. After converting logs to planks, it crafts a crafting table using the planks. Finally, it confirms the crafting of the crafting table.
