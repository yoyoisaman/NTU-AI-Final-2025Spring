async function mineCopperOre(bot) {
    // The function involves mining a copper ore using a stone pickaxe. It first checks if a stone pickaxe is available in the inventory, and if not, it crafts one by ensuring there are enough cobblestones and sticks, and placing a crafting table if necessary. Once the stone pickaxe is crafted or found, it is equipped. The function then searches for a copper ore block within a certain distance. If no copper ore is found nearby, it explores the area until one is located. Once a copper ore block is found, it is mined, and a message is displayed indicating the successful mining of the copper ore.
