async function mineThreeIronOre(bot) {
    // The function is about mining three iron ore blocks using an iron pickaxe. It first checks if an iron pickaxe is available in the inventory and equips it. Then, it searches for iron ore blocks within a specified distance. If fewer than three iron ore blocks are found, it explores the environment to locate more. Once at least three iron ore blocks are identified, it proceeds to mine them. If not enough iron ore is found, it indicates the failure to locate sufficient resources.
