async function smeltRawCopper(bot) {
    // The function involves smelting 3 raw copper into copper ingots using a furnace and coal as fuel. It first checks if a furnace is placed nearby within a 32-block radius. If no furnace is found, it places a furnace from the inventory at a position offset by one block from the bot's current position. Once the furnace is available, it proceeds to smelt the raw copper using coal. The process concludes with the successful conversion of raw copper into copper ingots.
