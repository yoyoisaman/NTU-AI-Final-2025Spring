async function mineJungleLogs(bot) {
    // The function is about collecting at least 3 jungle logs. It first checks the current inventory for the number of jungle logs. If there are already 3 or more, it stops further actions. If not, it searches for a jungle log within a certain distance. If no jungle log is found nearby, it explores the area to locate one. Once a jungle log is found, it mines the required number of logs to reach a total of 3.
