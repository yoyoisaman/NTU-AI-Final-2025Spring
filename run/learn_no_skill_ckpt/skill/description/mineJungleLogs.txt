async function mineJungleLogs(bot) {
    // The function is about collecting at least 3 jungle logs. It first checks the current inventory for the number of jungle logs. If there are already 3 or more, it stops further actions. If fewer than 3 logs are present, it searches for a jungle log within a 32-block radius. If no jungle log is found nearby, it explores the area to locate one. Once a jungle log is found, it mines the necessary number of logs to reach a total of 3.
