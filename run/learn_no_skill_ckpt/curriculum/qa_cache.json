Deal with them first to avoid being attacked while mining.\n\n3. **Mine at a Safe Level**: Iron ore is commonly found between levels 1 and 63. However, mining at levels 5-54 is generally safer as it avoids the surface and lava lakes found at lower levels.\n\n4. **Watch for Lava**: When mining, be cautious of lava pockets. Always stand to the side of the block you are mining so that if lava flows, it won't hit you directly. Carry a water bucket to quickly extinguish any lava.\n\n5. **Use Proper Tools**: Use at least a stone pickaxe to mine iron ore. Using a wooden pickaxe will not yield any iron.\n\n6. **Mine in a Pattern**: Use a branch mining technique to efficiently find iron ore while maintaining a safe environment. This involves creating a main tunnel and then mining side tunnels off of it.\n\n7. **Armor and Weapons**: Wear armor and carry a sword or bow to protect yourself from any unexpected mob encounters.\n\n8. **Listen for Sounds**: Pay attention to sounds of nearby mobs or lava, which can alert you to potential dangers.\n\nBy following these precautions, you can safely mine iron ore and minimize the risk of taking damage.", "How to smelt 4 raw gold in Minecraft?": "Answer: To smelt 4 raw gold in Minecraft, you will need a furnace and a fuel source.
